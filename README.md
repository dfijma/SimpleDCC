SimpleDCC
=========


Minimal demostration code to show how to generate a DCC signal using an Arduino UNO.
Setup uses a motor shield to boost the logic-level DCC signal to something a loco can draw power from (+/- 12V for N-scale).

For a more complete project (including Loconet and something more than just DCC Throttle and Idle command), see [Arduino DCC+LocoNet](https://github.com/dfijma/dcc).
